🐧My own FlappyBird remake in Java

Enjoy reading the Code or playing🎮 it!

## Known Bugs
* Some Sprites disappear (mostly when the Window is hidden)
  * Why does this occur? 
    The Application unloads some assets from the memory to fast and doesn't load it again. So they Sprites aren't anymore in Memory and can't be rendered


## What did I learn?
* How to work with LibGDX
